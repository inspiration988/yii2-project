in this project user fill the multipart form.
The user is able to leave the registration on every step/view until he finished the whole registration successfully. Accordingly to this he should be redirected to the last opened step when heâ€™s joining the process again(re-navigating to the webpage). So the state of already inserted data needs to be saved.
